# Phorg - a python application for photo organization

	This application was custom made by me for myself to help me organize my photos, cut back on the amount of storage space used, and keep
	statistics of my shooting patterns.
	

	Instructions on how to use this application/Workflow for downloading photos from camera


	1) 	Download all the photos into the 'unorganized' folder within the phorg application

	2) 	Open the Phorg application, navigate to the Organize Tab, and select run

	3) 	Go look in the organized folder within the Phorg application, your photos should be organized as such:
			By Month
				By Date
					By File type
						One folder named Highlights	(This folder should be empty)
						One Folder named JPG 		(All of your .JPG files should be here)
						One Folder named RAW 		(All of your .ARW files should be here)
						Dated .txt file 			(you can update the file with information about the shoot, such as location)

	4) 	Next, you need to look through the JPG files, decide which you think would like to keep (specifically which of hte photos you would like to keep in RAW
		form),and move the JPGs you would like to keep into the Highlights folder. After you have selected the highlights of each date that you enjoy and moved those JPGs in to the highlights folder within that date, you can go to the next step

	5)	Now you can open the Select tab within the Phorg application.
		The Purpose of this tab is to take the JPGs in the highlights folder on a specific date,
		find the corresponding .ARW (AKA RAW) files in the RAW for that same date,
		Then move the RAW files from the RAW files folder of said date to a new folder called 'Edits'
		
			Note: The camera I use right now is a Sony A6000, which names the .ARW files the same name as the .JPG files which enables this application to work
